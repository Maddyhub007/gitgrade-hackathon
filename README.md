# GitGrade 🚀

**GitGrade** is an AI-powered GitHub Repository Analyzer built as a solution for the **GitGrade Hackathon (UnsaidTalks)** under the theme **AI + Code Analysis + Developer Profiling**.

GitGrade acts as a *Repository Mirror* — it evaluates a developer’s GitHub repository and converts it into a **Score**, **Insightful Summary**, and a **Personalized Improvement Roadmap**, similar to guidance from an AI coding mentor.


## 🧠 Problem Statement

In today’s tech-driven hiring process, a GitHub repository represents a developer’s real-world skills. However, many students struggle to understand:

* How clean their code is
* How structured their project looks
* How recruiters or mentors perceive their repository

**GitGrade solves this problem** by automatically analyzing a public GitHub repository and providing honest, actionable feedback.


## ✨ Features

### ✅ Core Features

* 🔗 Accepts **any public GitHub repository URL**
* 📥 Fetches real-time repository data using GitHub API
* 🧪 Analyzes multiple dimensions of the repository
* 🧮 Generates an **overall score and grade**
* 📝 Produces a **clear written summary**
* 🛣️ Provides a **personalized improvement roadmap**

### 🚀 Advanced / Extra Features

* 📊 Interactive dashboard with charts & visualizations
* 📈 Category-wise scoring breakdown
* 🔍 Repository health indicators (README, license, activity, etc.)
* 🎯 Multi-tab dashboard (Overview, Insights, Roadmap, Metrics)
* 🌙 Modern dark UI with smooth animations
* ⏳ Real-time analysis progress indicators


## 🧩 Evaluation Dimensions

GitGrade evaluates repositories across **6 key dimensions**:

1. **Code Quality & Readability**
2. **Project Structure & Organization**
3. **Documentation Quality**
4. **Test Coverage & Maintainability**
5. **Commit History & Consistency**
6. **Community & Best Practices**

Each dimension contributes to the final score.


## 🏆 Output Generated

For every repository, GitGrade generates:

### 📌 1. Score / Rating

* Numerical score (0–100)
* Letter grade (A, B+, B, C+, etc.)

### 📌 2. Written Summary

A concise evaluation highlighting strengths and weaknesses.

**Example:**

> "Code structure is clean and consistent, but documentation and tests need improvement."

### 📌 3. Personalized Roadmap

Actionable, prioritized steps such as:

* Improve folder structure
* Add or enhance README.md
* Write unit/integration tests
* Follow Git best practices (branches, commits, PRs)
* Add CI/CD pipelines


## 🖥️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
* **Visualization:** Charts & graphs for analytics
* **API:** GitHub REST API
* **Styling:** Modern UI with gradients & animations


## ▶️ How It Works

1. User enters a **GitHub Repository URL**
2. GitGrade fetches repository metadata and statistics
3. Analysis engine evaluates the repository
4. Dashboard displays:

   * Overall score & grade
   * Category-wise breakdown
   * Insights & roadmap
